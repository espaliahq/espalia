      The MCP tool surface diverged from the committed snapshot.

      If this was intentional (you added/removed/renamed an Operation,
      or changed its category/approval/parameters), update the
      `expected_snapshot` method in this file to match. If it wasn't —
      reverse whatever introduced the unintended Operation.
